### 1-10-2019

This Repo/directory is made for education
This is to be a very fun and importent asignment (extra credit).
In it I will be given code that does not work properly.
I will then have to fix it! The challenge is that I will have
to figure out what the code does, where it is going wrong and
possably how to even read the language it is in.
